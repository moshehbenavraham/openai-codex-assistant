# `PAI` - Personal AI Infrastructure

### <code>PAI</code> is an open-source personal AI infrastructure for orchestrating your life and work

<br />


## 🎯 **What is PAI?**

PAI is a project designed to give anyone in the world a personal AI infrastructure for orchestrating their personal and professional lives.

Based off my own personal Digital Assistant, **Codex-Atlas**, it combines a scaffolding framework with a growing set of real-world examples.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Quick Start**

One thing to note is that when you download the project, the.Claude directory is hidden by default because it's a dot directory. So cd into `.claude` when you're done with the instructions.

`cd .claude`

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <website here>

# 2. Check out the files (the folder is hidden with default `ls`)

ls -lah
cd ~/.claude/
ls -lah

```

### **Prerequisites**

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) - The primary AI interface, which can be any similar system
- Text editor (any will work - it's all Markdown/Text!)
- Ideal: Basic command line familiarity

## 💡 **Philosophy**

<div align="center">

### **Human 3.0: Augmentation, Not Replacement**

</div>

The PAI system embodies a fundamental belief: **AI should amplify human capability, not replace it.**

| Traditional AI | PAI Approach |
|----------------|--------------|
| Black box decisions | Transparent, file-based logic |
| Vendor lock-in | Completely portable |
| Forgets everything | Persistent memory |
| Generic responses | Personalized to you |
| Replaces thinking | Augments capability |

<br/>

## 📚 **Examples**

Coming soon! Each example will include:
