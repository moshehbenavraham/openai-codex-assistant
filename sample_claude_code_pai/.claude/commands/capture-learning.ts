## üé≠ The Full Story

### The Problem We Encountered

${problem}

### What We Initially Thought

We thought that ${initialAssumption}

This led us to believe the system worked in a certain way, and we approached the problem with these assumptions.

### What We Discovered Was Actually True

What we realized was that ${actualReality}

This was different from our initial understanding and required us to rethink our approach.

### The Journey: Troubleshooting Steps We Took

${troubleshootingSteps}

These steps helped us uncover the real issue and guided us toward the solution.

### The Solution That Worked

${solution}

This solution addressed the actual problem rather than what we initially thought was wrong.

---

## üéØ The Lesson Learned

**So now we know:** ${takeaway}

This changes how we approach similar problems in the future because we understand the underlying mechanism better.

---

## üìã Quick Reference

**Before:** We thought ${initialAssumption.substring(0, 100)}...

**After:** We know ${actualReality.substring(0, 100)}...

**Action:** ${takeaway}
