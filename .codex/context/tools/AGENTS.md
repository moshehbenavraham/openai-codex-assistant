## Playwright MCP Server ‚Äî Your Eyes

This MCP server is how we debug and validate anything in the browser. Always spin it up through the bridge so you inherit my logged-in Chrome profile.

### Hard Rules

- Launch with `mcp__playwright__` and pass `--browser chrome --extension`
- The bridge opens a fresh Chrome window on my Work profile; leave existing windows alone
- Never run Playwright headless here; screenshots and interactions must reflect my real environment
- Stay inside Playwright for visual checks, DOM scraping, screenshots, and interaction flows

### Launch Pattern

```
mcp__playwright__ tools --browser chrome --extension
```

That command routes through the bridge extension, attaches to the active Chrome profile, and boots a clean window. Every troubleshooting session starts with that exact incantation.

### Common Uses

- Smoke-test new builds against live auth sessions
- Capture screenshots or recordings to document regressions
- Inspect network calls or console errors in context
- Reproduce user flows while seeing the exact state I see

If the bridge fails, rebuild the session instead of falling back to headless mode. Headless runs break parity with my environment and are off-limits unless I sign off explicitly.
